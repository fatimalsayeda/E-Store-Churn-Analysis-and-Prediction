Executive Summary
E-Store-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction
This project represents an end-to-end (E2E) solution starting with the generation of Arabic fake data, followed by data cleansing and exploratory analysis (EDA), implementation of a predictive model aimed at identifying customers at high risk of churning from an e-store  (Churn Risk). 

Tech Stack (Technology & Purpose)
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and feature engineering.
Scikit-learn: Building and evaluating the predictive model.
Seaborn, Matplotlib: Data visualization for exploratory analysis.
Faker, Arabic-Reshaper: Generating the fake Arabic data and formatting it.

Core Project Deliverables
The project is structured into
1- Arabic Fake Data Generation: Creation of a realistic customer behavior database reflecting E-Store purchase patterns, providing a safe environment for testing.
2- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering: Handling of missing data and necessary transformations.
3- Exploratory Analysis (EDA): Identifying and confirming the negative correlation between key KPIs (e.g., Total Orders) and the probability of customer churn. This analysis helps in making swift decisions to identify the segment most in need of proactive retention campaigns. 
4- Modeling (ML) – Simple Model: Implementation of a Balanced Random Forest Model. Class imbalance handling was applied, which effectively boosted the model's ability to detect churning customers (Recall).

Result:
Increasing the model's effectiveness in capturing critical cases, which significantly elevates Recall and makes the model highly effective and ready for use in anticipating customer loss (Churn Risk).
