The E-Store-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction project represents an end-to-end (E2E) solution, starting with the generation of Arabic fake data, followed by data cleansing and exploratory analysis (EDA), and the implementation of a predictive model aimed at identifying customers at high risk of churning from an e-store (Churn Risk).

Tech Stack (Technology & Purpose):
Faker, Arabic-Reshaper: Generating the fake Arabic data and formatting it.
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and feature engineering.
Seaborn, Matplotlib: Data visualization for exploratory analysis.
Scikit-learn: Building and evaluating the predictive model.

Core Project Deliverables:
The project is structured into
1- Arabic Fake Data Generation: Creation of a realistic customer behavior database reflecting E-Store purchase patterns, providing a safe environment for testing.
2- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering: Handling of missing data and necessary transformations.
3- Exploratory Analysis (EDA): Identifying the negative correlation between key KPIs (e.g., Total Orders) and the probability of customer churn, and confirming the segment most in need of proactive retention campaigns.
4- Modeling (ML) – Simple Model: Implementation of a Balanced Random Forest Model. Class imbalance handling was applied, which effectively boosted the model's ability to detect churning customers (Recall).

Result:
Increasing the model's effectiveness in capturing critical cases, which significantly elevates Recall and makes the model highly effective and ready for use in anticipating customer loss (Churn Risk).
